# putitoff
Task from the past

putitoff will be a task orgainzer for you to attach a task to a date.  putitoff won't bother you about the task again until whatever date you set has come to pass.

The functional goal is to replace those giant desk calendars that help productivity oh so very much, but without the constant reminder of all the tasks you have for the next day.
